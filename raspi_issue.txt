There is problem after installation pip package with opencv on fresh raspbian system.
To fix this you must do:
sudo apt-get install libatlas-base-dev libjasper-dev libqtgui4 libqt4-test libhdf5-dev libhdf5-serial-dev
After this "import cv2 should work"

If you want use dedicated camera for raspberry pi remember to run 
sudo modprobe bcm2835-v4l2
Without run this script, Raspbian can't find/open device
